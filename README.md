# Scheduling-Algorithms-With-Gui
Python Tkinter made GUI to test some of the most common scheduling algorithms like (Fifo, Robin round, Shortest job first, Brute force...) along with another custom implementation scheduler
Add to tasks in commands.txt in format (name, arrival time, execution time, maximum time before considering it as a delayed task)
The best algorithms is the one with the least delay time
